# Express.js Route Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  Specifically, this example shows a route that retrieves user data by ID.  If an invalid ID is provided, the application might crash or return an unexpected response.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The route handler lacks error handling for invalid user IDs.  This can lead to issues like database errors or undefined behavior if the user ID doesn't correspond to a valid record.  For example, if a user tries to access `/users/abc`, an error could occur.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code. It includes error handling to gracefully manage invalid user IDs and return an appropriate response to the client.
